# InCS_Project
Penetration testing, exploitation interactions and credential harvest.

A little InCS project done on Kali Linux with super duper tools that gave m ethe chance to explore a bit and have fun...a lot of fun.
Actually after the project I had even more fun. Of course legal one! We are good people here!

Take a look, I think it is pretty neat :))))
It made me a bit a bit 'messy-depressy lemon courtesy' instead of 'easy-peasy lemon squezy', but it was worth it.

P.S. I swear I can be serious, I swear!
